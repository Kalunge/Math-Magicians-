    There’s a secret world out there. A hidden parallel universe of beauty and elegance, intricately intertwined with ours. It’s the world of mathematics. And it’s invisible to most of us. This book is an invitation to discover this world.

    nsider this paradox: On the one hand, mathematics is woven in the very fabric of our daily lives. Every time we make an online purchase, send a text message, do a search on the Internet, or use a GPS device, mathematical formulas and algorithms are at play. On the other hand, most people are daunted by math. It has become, in the words of poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger, “a blind spot in our culture – alien territory, in which only the elite, the initiated few have managed to entrench themselves.” It’s rare, he says, that we “encounter a person who asserts vehemently that the mere thought of reading a novel, or looking at a picture, or seeing a movie causes him insufferable torment,” but “sensible, educated people” often say “with a remarkable blend of defiance and pride” that math is “pure torture” or a “nightmare” that “turns them off.”

    How is this anomaly possible? I see two main reasons. First, mathematics is more abstract than other subjects, hence not as accessible. Second, what we study in school is only a tiny part of math, much of it established more than a millennium ago. Mathematics has advanced tremendously since then, but the treasures of modern math have been kept hidden from most of us.

      We will always have STEM with us. Some things will drop out of the public eye and go away, but there will always be science, engineering, and technology. And there will always, always be mathematics.
