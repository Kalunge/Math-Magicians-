      There’s a secret world out there. A hidden parallel universe of beauty and
      elegance, intricately intertwined with ours. It’s the world of
      mathematics. And it’s invisible to most of us. This book is an invitation
      to discover this world.

      nsider this paradox: On the one hand, mathematics is woven in the very
      fabric of our daily lives. Every time we make an online purchase, send a
      text message, do a search on the Internet, or use a GPS device,
      mathematical formulas and algorithms are at play. On the other hand, most
      people are daunted by math. It has become, in the words of poet Hans
      Magnus Enzensberger, “a blind spot in our culture – alien territory, in
      which only the elite, the initiated few have managed to entrench
      themselves.” It’s rare, he says, that we “encounter a person who asserts
      vehemently that the mere thought of reading a novel, or looking at a
      picture, or seeing a movie causes him insufferable torment,” but
      “sensible, educated people” often say “with a remarkable blend of defiance
      and pride” that math is “pure torture” or a “nightmare” that “turns them
      off.”

      How is this anomaly possible? I see two main reasons. First, mathematics
      is more abstract than other subjects, hence not as accessible. Second,
      what we study in school is only a tiny part of math, much of it
      established more than a millennium ago. Mathematics has advanced
      tremendously since then, but the treasures of modern math have been kept
      hidden from most of us.
